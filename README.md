# MathEditor
This is a simple LaTeX-based equation editor that I made for myself.  It's not the most user friendly, but it generally works.  I think I've fixed most of the major bugs, but feel free to make a pull request if you find something yourself and want to fix it.

To use it, just download all files and put them in the same directory (also put the mathquill folder in that directory), then open the editor.html file.

I used the MathQuill library to make this.  Check it out: http://docs.mathquill.com/en/latest/
